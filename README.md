# Kaiju
Kaiju is a social media app for artists, loosely inspired by X (Twitter). It's split into two main parts: the client and the server.

Kaiju has the basics covered posting, liking, commenting, creating and deleting posts, updating profiles, managing public/private accounts, blocking users, and changing email and passwords. But to be honest, it's far from finished. This project was more of an experiment for me to learn new things.

I enjoyed diving into how to manage data and build out features, but somewhere along the way, I lost interest. So, a lot of important stuff is still missing like notifications, messaging, an explore page, a search feature, and even a logout option (the backend has the endpoint, but I never hooked it up on the frontend). Also, passwords? Yeah, they're not encrypted yet. I also planned to integrate AI, but that never made it into the project.

Kaiju isn’t polished or ready for prime time it’s a bit of a mess but it taught me a lot. Now, I'm ready to take what I’ve learned and approach my next projects with a more professional mindset, aiming for cleaner code and more complete feature sets.
